# Object Oriented Programming (DIEF, UNIMORE) #
This is an intermediate programming course about the Object Oriented methodology and Java. We recommend this course to learners who have previous experience in software development or a background in computer science.  At the end of this course, learners will be empowered to create a real-world Java program. In achieving this goal, students will learn the fundamentals of Object Oriented Programming, how to leverage the power of existing libraries, how to build graphical user interfaces, how to use some core algorithms for searching and sorting data and how to read and write data both locally and from the network.

## How to use it ##
The whole material, comprising slides and code examples, can be downloaded using git:

* $ git clone https://github.com/nbicocchi/ooprogramming.git

Both slides and code examples might be updated or bug-fixed during the course. At any time, for downloading the
latest version, go the course material directory (on your pc) and use:

* $ git pull

Code examples can be directly imported and run in Eclipse with:

* File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace

[M12] Threads Synchronisation

* Race conditions
* Deadlock, Livelock, Starvation
* Advanced synchronisation (wait/notify)

## Course Rules ##
The final exam of this course is a discussion about a project to be developed at home. It is worth noticing that the project is not supposed to be developed without supervision, but mostly during the course. The whole development process and related discussions with Prof. Bicocchi will be evaluated. The general idea of the project must be defined before mid-term.

At the final discussion, it is expected:

* to pass an oral examination about OOP and the Java language (short written exercises might be used, see topics above) 

* to successfully discuss about the structure, the internals and engineering choices of the project


## Course Books ##
In the following there is list of good books to be used during the development, ordered by difficulty. At the end of the course students are expected to understand and use concepts of intermediate level. Advanced level is only for students with a remarkable programming background.

* Programmazione a oggetti in Java; Giacomo Cabri, Franco Zambonelli (beginner)

* Thinking in Java; Bruce Eckel (intermediate)

* Effective Java; Joshua Bloch (advanced)

* Design Patterns; Eric and Elisabeth Freeman (advanced)
