/**
 * Create class SavingsAccount. Use a static variable annualInterestRate to store 
 * the annual interest rate for all account holders. Provide a static method 
 * modifyInterestRate that sets the annualInterestRate to a new value.
 * 
 * The class contains a private instance variable "balance" indicating the 
 * amount of the deposit. 
 * 
 * Provide a method calculateMonthlyInterest to calculate 
 * the monthly interest by multiplying the balance by annualInterestRate 
 * divided by 12. 
 * 
 * Write a program to test the class SavingsAccount. Instantiate two savingsAccount 
 * objects, saver1 and saver2, with balances of $2000.00 and $3000.00, respectively. 
 * Set annualInterestRate to 4%, then calculate the monthly interest and print the 
 * new balances for both savers. Then set the annualInterestRate to 5%, calculate 
 * the next monthâ€™s interest and print the new balances for both savers.
